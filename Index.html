			<div class="sectitle">
				
				<h4> 1-1: The Basics of the Web and HTML </h4>
				
				<div class="notes">
					A user requests a web page from a server via HTTP, the server then sends the page to the users browser. 
					<br>
					HTML = <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> <BR>
					<br>									
					Inline vs. Block Elements <br>
					<em>Block elements</em> such as div and p form a invisible box around <br>their contents.<br> 
					<em>Inline elements</em> such as b and span do not form a invisible box around their contents.

				<h4> 1-2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML </h4>
				<div class="notes">
					<b><em>Structured Documents</em></b><br>
					Note: This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document">Wikipedia</a> article perfects sums up what a structured document is ; <br>
					<em>"A structured document is an electronic document where some<br> method of embedded coding, such as mark-up, is used to give the<br> whole, and parts, of the document various structural meanings according <br>to a schema. A structured document whose mark-up doesn't break the schema<br> and is designed to conform to and which obeys the syntax rules of its mark-up<br> language is "well-formed". " </em>

				<h4> 1-3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure </h4>
				<div class="notes">
					CSS = Cascading Style Sheets <br>
					<br>
					CSS Styles can be used in a few different ways <BR>
					1. Write CSS in the head of the HTML file <BR>
					2. Link the HTML file to a seperate CSS file <BR>
					3. Write the stlye inline with your HTML <BR>
					<br>
					Code ---> Test ---> Refine <br>
					1. Look for natural boxes <br>
					2. look for repeated styles and semantic elements <br>
					3. write your HTML <br>
					4. Apply styles <br>
					5. fix things <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b><em>Repetition</em></b><br>
					you can avoid uneccessary repetition in the code by using things such as syles and <br> classes in CSS.
					This is done to save time, make the code easier
					to read and <br>also easier to maintain. <br>
					<br>
					For example: when you make a change to a single class in CSS, which is repeated<br> throughout the code all the same elements defined as that class will change. <br>
					This method is far easier then having to make many of the same changes throughout<br>
					the code individually, and helps prefvent errors throughout the code. <br>

				<div class="sectitle">
					<h4> 2-1: Introduction to "Serious" Programming </h4>
					<div class="notes">
					Computer language has to be different from the natural language
					that is spoken by us. <br>Natural languages are abstract and we naturally can infer meanings from what is said. <br> A computer can not do this and needs percise correct instructions.	<br>
					<br>
					Mistakes or "bugs" are going to happen, it is inevitable and <br> happens to everyone. Write code ... test .... fix .. repeat <br>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="sectitle">
					<h4> 2-2: Variables and Strings </h4>
					<div class="notes">
					<em>Variables are a storage location paired with an associated <br>symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or <br>unknown quantity or information referred to as a value. <br> </em>
					<br>
					Example: New_Name = 1.14 <br>
					<br>
					Number = 4 (int)<br>
					Number = "4" (string) <br>
					<br>
					<em><b>Indexing</b></em> starts with 0 so with Hello, H is at 0 , e is at 1 <br>
					to pull the index value from a variable<br> 
					it is done like so: newvalue = valuename[1]  ; this will make <br>
					newvalue = e if valuename is Hello <br>
					to get a sequentce use [number : number] <br>
					ex. valuename[0:3] will return character 0,1,2 of the valuename<br>
					other uses [3:] will be the third character to the end <br>
					[:3] will be character 0 to the third character<br>
					<br>
					the <b>method</b> find can be used to find the position for where a <br>
					character or string can be found <br>
					ex. text.find('hello')
					</div>
